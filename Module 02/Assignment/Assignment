Build upon the product catalog tutorial by adding the functionality
to search by product type or by price.

- Search by product type
- Search by product price 

The users should be able to 

- populate the similar product list when search by type with valid type 
- populate the similar product list when products within $50 when search by price with valid price
- populate the examined result by either search or clicking examine
- see an error alert when searching for an invalid id, type, or price
